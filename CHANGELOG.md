## [Unreleased]

### Added
- RFC-0006 (plugin host & WIT ABI): the `cairn:plugin@1.0.0` WIT package (`types`/`host`/`backend`
  interfaces, `backend-plugin` world), the host↔guest mapping onto the `Vfs` trait, the
  capability-grant and credential-brokering model, resource limits/cancellation, and WIT semver
  rules — building on ADR-0004 and the M8-2 runtime core (M8-1).
- `cairn-backend-k8s`: the Kubernetes backend's `Vfs` mapping over a `KubeOps` transport seam — a
  navigable cluster tree (`/<context>/<namespace>/<pod>/<container>/<path…>`) with capabilities that
  vary by depth (list-only navigation; file read inside a container), fully unit-tested against an
  in-memory mock. Read-only mapping core; the live `kube-rs` adapter (auth via the broker,
  tar-over-`exec` filesystem) and the action surface (logs/exec/port-forward) are the integration
  step. RFC-0005 (M6-4/M6-5). Surfaces init/ephemeral containers via the new
  `EntryExt::KubeContainer` variant (`cairn-types`).
- `cairn-vfs`: `join_abs_path`, a shared helper for backends that map a subtree onto a remote
  filesystem (used by the Docker and Kubernetes backends).
- `cairn-backend-docker`: the Docker/OCI backend's `Vfs` mapping over a `ContainerOps` transport
  seam — a navigable tree (`/containers/<name>/…` browses a container's filesystem, `/images/<tag>`
  lists images), read-only, fully unit-tested against an in-memory mock, plus a `bollard` adapter
  that lists containers and images live. In-container filesystem access (tar/exec) and a live daemon
  are the integration step; RFC-0004 (M6-1/M6-2).
- `cairn-backend-ssh`: the SSH/SFTP backend's `Vfs` mapping over an `SftpOps` transport seam
  (list/stat/ranged-read/write/mkdir/rename/recursive-remove), fully unit-tested against an
  in-memory mock, plus a `russh-sftp` adapter; RFC-0003. Live SSH transport is the integration
  step (M4-1/M4-2).
- `cairn-plugin`: the sandboxed WASM plugin host on `wasmtime` — instantiate untrusted modules
  with a memory cap and execution-fuel limit (a runaway guest traps instead of hanging the host),
  and default-deny host imports (capability-gated). Hermetic, WAT-module tests (M8-2).
- `cairn-backend-object`: the provider-agnostic object-store core — the `ObjectStore` trait,
  prefix/delimiter listing synthesis (object-vs-prefix, directory-marker folding), an
  `ObjectStoreVfs` mapping onto `Vfs`, and an in-memory `MockObjectStore`. Cloud providers
  (S3/GCS/Azure) are feature-gated and not yet implemented (M5-1/M5-2).
- `cairn-ai` context & injection defense: a secrets-free `WorldSnapshot` for the model, an
  `<untrusted_data>` wrapper that neutralizes break-out attempts, an out-of-scope heuristic, and
  the standing system policy (M7-5).
- `cairn-ai`: the agentic AI core — a provider-agnostic `LlmProvider` trait + `MockProvider`, the
  closed tool surface (capability per tool; unknown tools rejected), and the plan→confirm→execute
  state machine (bulk-approve only when every step is safe/recoverable; failure aborts the rest).
  Hermetic (M7-3/M7-4; trait+mock for M7-1).
- `cairn-broker`: the capability broker — the sole mediator that resolves a credential id to a
  secret (journaled), with a secret-free world view for untrusted actors (M3-5).
- `cairn-config`: TOML configuration with connection profiles that reference a vault credential
  by id and cannot hold a secret by construction (M3-6).
- `cairn-secrets`: zeroizing secret types and a log-redaction helper.
- `cairn-vault`: encrypted secrets vault (XChaCha20-Poly1305 + Argon2id, header bound as AAD,
  atomic writes); passphrase unlock; 7 hermetic crypto tests (M3-1/M3-2).
- File operations in the TUI: copy (`c`/F5), move (`m`/F6), and delete (`d`/F8, with a confirm
  dialog) of the marked/current entries between panes, via the transfer engine; status feedback
  and auto-refresh (M2-6/M2-7).
- `cairn-transfer`: the transfer engine — stream-through copy/move across any two backends,
  directory-tree walk, server-side-copy fast path, conflict policies, size verification, and
  cooperative cancellation; RFC-0002. 6 hermetic tests (M2-1..4).
- `cairn-tui` (ratatui dual-pane render + keymap) and the binary event loop / effect runner:
  `cairn` now opens an interactive dual-pane local-filesystem browser — navigate, switch panes,
  mark, refresh, quit; non-blocking (M1-5/6/7/8). Graceful message when not run in a TTY.
- `cairn-core`: the Elm/TEA app model and pure `update` reducer (panes, cursor/marks, navigate,
  list events) — no I/O, 10 tests (M1-4).
- `cairn-backend-local`: the local filesystem backend over `tokio::fs` (list, stat, ranged
  read/write, mkdir/remove/rename, Unix perms), with RFC-0001 (M1-2/M1-3).
- Engineering rule: use the Context7 MCP for current library/API docs (CLAUDE.md §10, §13).
- `cairn-vfs`: the `Vfs` trait (object-safe, `#[async_trait]`, streaming `list`), capability
  provider, `ReadHandle`/`WriteHandle`, `VfsRegistry`, the action interface, and `MockVfs` (M1).
- `cairn-types` crate: `VfsPath` (normalized, traversal-safe), `Entry`/`EntryKind`/`EntryExt`,
  the `Caps` capability model, and `ConnectionId`/`Scheme` — the shared leaf vocabulary (M0).
- Binary edge: tracing init (`CAIRN_LOG`), a panic hook, and `--version`/`--help` (M0).
- Project scaffolding: engineering rules (`CLAUDE.md`), contribution and governance docs,
  GitHub issue/PR templates, CI workflow, and a minimal Cargo workspace.

### Changed
- Tuned workspace clippy lints for velocity under CI's `-D warnings`: deny `clippy::all` + forbid
  unsafe + require rustdoc, but drop the over-broad `pedantic`/`unwrap_used`/`expect_used` lints
  (advisory via review per CLAUDE.md §9, not a hard test-breaking gate).
- Product Requirements Document (`docs/PRD.md`).
- Team-of-agents working model in `CLAUDE.md` §2: every feature and significant decision is
  run past the relevant specialist agent(s), with a domain→agent mapping.
- Vendored specialist agents under `.claude/agents/` so every contributor shares the same team.
  Includes Cairn-specific agents authored for this project: `tui-engineer`,
  `ai-integration-engineer`, `plugin-systems-engineer`, `container-backend-engineer`,
  `technical-writer`, plus client-backend-focused `kube-staff-engineer`, `network-engineer`,
  `storage-engineer`, and a Rust-focused `code-reviewer`.
- Low-Level Design (`docs/LLD.md`): architecture, the core async VFS abstraction + capability
  model, tokio/TEA app model, transfer engine, object-store backends, secrets vault + AI/plugin
  broker boundary, AI agentic layer, and WASM plugin system.
- ADRs recording the load-bearing decisions: core architecture (ADR-0001), vault crypto + broker
  boundary (ADR-0002), object-store SDKs (ADR-0003), WASM plugin runtime (ADR-0004).
- Implementation Plan & living progress tracker (`docs/IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md`): milestones M0–M8 +
  v0.1, work breakdown with status, critical path & dependency DAG, parallelization lanes, RFC
  sequencing, risk register, and a same-PR status-update rule (CLAUDE.md §5).
- GitHub Milestones M0–M8 + v0.1 backing the tracker.

### Changed
- Renumbered `CLAUDE.md` sections to accommodate the new team-of-agents model (§2).
