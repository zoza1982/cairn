## [Unreleased]

### Added
- Project scaffolding: engineering rules (`CLAUDE.md`), contribution and governance docs,
  GitHub issue/PR templates, CI workflow, and a minimal Cargo workspace.
- Product Requirements Document (`docs/PRD.md`).
- Team-of-agents working model in `CLAUDE.md` §2: every feature and significant decision is
  run past the relevant specialist agent(s), with a domain→agent mapping.
- Vendored specialist agents under `.claude/agents/` so every contributor shares the same team.
  Includes Cairn-specific agents authored for this project: `tui-engineer`,
  `ai-integration-engineer`, `plugin-systems-engineer`, `container-backend-engineer`,
  `technical-writer`, plus client-backend-focused `kube-staff-engineer`, `network-engineer`,
  `storage-engineer`, and a Rust-focused `code-reviewer`.
- Low-Level Design (`docs/LLD.md`): architecture, the core async VFS abstraction + capability
  model, tokio/TEA app model, transfer engine, object-store backends, secrets vault + AI/plugin
  broker boundary, AI agentic layer, and WASM plugin system.
- ADRs recording the load-bearing decisions: core architecture (ADR-0001), vault crypto + broker
  boundary (ADR-0002), object-store SDKs (ADR-0003), WASM plugin runtime (ADR-0004).

### Changed
- Renumbered `CLAUDE.md` sections to accommodate the new team-of-agents model (§2).
